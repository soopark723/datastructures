    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity: Big O\n",
    "The function fib_recursive(n) calls itself twice for each input n > 2: The first call is fib_recursive(n-1); the second call is fib_recursive(n-2). This creates a binary recursion tree, where each level of the tree produces two recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion Tree Structure: At the first level, the function is called with n. The second level involves two calls: fib_recursive(n-1) and fib_recursive(n-2). The third level has four calls: fib_recursive(n-2), fib_recursive(n-3), fib_recursive(n-3), and fib_recursive(n-4). This pattern continues until we reach the base cases (n == 0 or n == 1), which are the stopping conditions of the recursion. The number of calls grows exponentially. Specifically, for each call, there are two subsequent calls that are each evaluated recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrence relation for the time complexity is approximately: T(n) = T(n−1) + T(n−2) + O(1), where the additional O(1) accounts for the constant time for checking conditions (n == 0, n == 1, n == 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This recurrence has a solution that is exponential, specifically O(2^n). This means the function's time complexity grows exponentially with respect to n. \n",
    "Final Time Complexity (Big O): O(2^n).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity: Big Ω\n",
    "Big Omega (Ω) represents the best-case time complexity, or the lower bound.\n",
    "For this recursive Fibonacci function: In the best-case scenario, the input n could be small (like n == 0 or n == 1), which would directly return a result without any recursion. In this case, the time complexity for fib_recursive(0) or fib_recursive(1) is O(1), which means only a constant amount of work is done. So, the Big Omega (Ω) time complexity for the best case is: Ω(1). This is the minimum amount of work done when n is small and reaches the base case immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity\n",
    "The space complexity is based on the depth of the recursion stack since each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack.\n",
    "In the worst case, the recursion depth is equal to n (for example, when the input is a large number like n = 100).\n",
    "So, the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive calls that go as deep as n."
